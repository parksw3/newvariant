Dear Editors:

We are submitting our manuscript, “Roles of generation-interval distributions in shaping relative epidemic strength, speed, and control of new SARS-CoV-2 variants”, for consideration for publication in PRSB. This material has not previously been published elsewhere.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of characterizing the spread of new variants. Previous studies have particularly prioritized estimating the relative strength (i.e., the ratio of reproduction numbers) from relative speed (i.e., the differences between growth rates). 

Our study asks how generation intervals (i.e., the time between infection and transmission) shape the link between the relative speed and strength. We consider the possibility that new variants can have different generation intervals in light of recent evidence that the increasingly predominant B.1.1.7 variant may have a longer infectious period  (and therefore, a longer generation interval). We show that neglecting these differences can lead to biased inference and use simulations to illustrate how such biases can be assessed in practice. Differences in generation intervals also have important implications for control: if new variants have longer generation intervals then speed-like interventions such as contact tracing become more effective, whereas strength-like interventions such as social distancing become less effective.

The manuscript and its findings should be of interest to a broad range of readers, particularly given its theoretical and practical implications for characterizing the spread of new variants. All code is available as open-source for use, re-use, and adaptation by the community. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.

Sincerely,

Sang Woo Park

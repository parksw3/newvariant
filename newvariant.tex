\section*{Abstract}

Characterizing epidemic dynamics of new SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical to predicting the future course of the pandemic.
Here, we explore how assumptions about the relative strength (i.e., ratio of reproduction numbers $\RR$) and relative speed (i.e., differences in growth rates $r$) of the new variant affect conclusions about expected rates of variant takeover and viral spread under various conditions.
We show that failing to account for the possibility that the new variant has longer generation intervals can lead to considerable biases in the inferences about the relative reproductive number (strength) of the new variant.
For example, the plausible assumption that the mean generation interval of the new variant is 40\% longer than that of the wild type can lead to biases of up to 40\% in estimates of  the relative transmissibility of the new variant.
We suggest that better estimates of viral generation intervals could improve forecasts of variant takeover and viral spread. 

\section{Introduction}

Since the emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VoC), estimating its epidemic strength and speed remains one of the key questions in controlling its spread \citep{switzerland2021variant, davies2021estimated, di2021impact, leung2021early, volz2021transmission,zhao2021}.
Epidemic strength, characterized by the reproduction number $\RR$, provides information about the final size of the epidemic as well as the amount of intervention required to eliminate the disease \citep{anderson1991infectious}.
Epidemic speed, characterized by the growth rate $r$ provides information about the population-level time scale of the epidemic and, potentially provides information on when the new variant will replace the existing variant as the dominant strain.
Strength and speed are linked by generation intervals---defined as time between infection and transmission---which characterizes individual-level time scale of the epidemic \citep{roberts2007model,svensson2007note,wallinga2007generation}.

Many studies have tried to estimate the strength of the novel variant from the observed speed \citep{davies2021estimated, leung2021early, volz2021transmission,zhao2021}.
In contrast, some studies have assumed a value of the strength of the novel variant and tried to predict future spread (therefore, the speed) of the variant \citep{davies2021estimated}.
While both approaches are reasonable in principle, holding different quantities constant (i.e., strength or speed) can lead to different conclusions, in practice, about the spread of the disease, and therefore, its control.
The reason is that inference of speed from strength and strength from speed depends on assumptions about the generation-interval distribution \citep{roberts2007model,svensson2007note,wallinga2007generation,dushoff2020speed}.
For example, when we assume a fixed value of epidemic strength, longer generation intervals lead to faster epidemic (lower $r$), making the epidemic seem easier to control.
When we assume a fixed value of epidemic speed, longer generation intervals lead to stronger epidemic (higher $\RR$), making the epidemic seem more difficult to control.

In addition, most studies have assumed that the generation-interval distributions do not differ between the existing strain and the variant, but recent evidence suggests that the new variant may have a longer duration of infection: 13.3 days (90\% CI: 10.1--16.5) for the new variant and 8.2 days (90\% CI: 6.5--9.7) for the wild type \citep{kissler2021densely}.
Longer duration of infection could lead to longer periods of transmission, meaning that the mean generation interval of the new variant is likely to be longer than that of the wild type.
Other studies have also considered the possibility that the new variant may have shorter generation intervals to account for faster growth rate \citep{davies2021estimated}.
More information is needed, however: generation intervals depend on many other biological and behavioral factors, including for example self-isolation after symptom onset leading to shorter generation intervals.
Nonetheless, if the generation-interval distribution of the new variant is different from the generation-interval distribution of the wild type, current estimates of the strength of the new variants may be biased.

Here, we explore how different assumptions about the new variant affect estimates of its strength and speed given the possibility that it might have different generation intervals.
We examine how the estimates of relative strength (i.e., the ratio between the strength of the existing strain and the variant) and speed (i.e., the difference between the speed of the existing strain and the variant) depend on each other.
We then show how neglecting differences in the generation-interval distributions can lead to biased estimates, which, in turn, infleunce mitigation priorities.

\section{Renewal equation framework}

We use the renewal equation framework to characterize the spread of two pathogen strains---in this case, the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus and a focal variant of concern (e.g., B.1.1.7).
Neglecting the (relatively slow) rate of new mutations, the current incidence of infection $i_x(t)$ caused by the wild type ($x=w$) and the variant ($x=v$) can be expressed in terms of their previous incidence $i_x(t-\tau)$ and the rate at which secondary cases are generated at time $t$ by individuals infected $\tau$ time units ago $K_x(t, \tau)$:
\begin{equation}
i_x(t) = \int_0^\infty i_x(t-\tau) K_x(t, \tau) \dtau.
\end{equation}
This framework provides a flexible way of modeling disease dynamics and generalizes compartmental models, such as the SEIR model \citep{heesterbeek1996concept, diekmann2000mathematical, roberts2004modelling, aldis2005integral, roberts2007model, champredon2018equivalence}.

The integral of the kernel $\RR_x(t) = \int K_x(t, \tau) \dtau$---referred to as the instantaneous reproduction number---describes the average infectiousness of previously infected individuals at time $t$ \citep{fraser2007estimating}.
The normalized kernel $g_x(t, \tau) = K_x(t, \tau)/\RR_x(t)$---which we refer to as the instantaneous generation-interval distribution---describes their relative contribution to current incidence $i_x(t)$ and provides information about the time scale of disease transmission.
Both the reproduction number and the generation-interval distribution can depend on several factors, including intrinsic infectiousness of an infected individual, non-pharmaceutical interventions, awareness-driven behavior, and population-level susceptibility \citep{fraser2007estimating}.

Over a short period of time, we can assume that epidemiological conditions remain roughly constant: $\RR_x(t) \approx \RR_x$ and $g_x(t, \tau) \approx g_x(\tau)$.
In this case, the incidence of either strains can exhibit exponential growth or decay at rate $r_x$, satisfying the Euler-Lotka equation \citep{wallinga2007generation}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\RR_x} = \int_0^\infty \exp(- r_x \tau) g_x(\tau) \dtau.
\end{equation}
We can approximate the $r$--$\RR$ relationship by assuming that the generation-interval distribution is approximately gamma-distributed, and summarizing it using the mean generation interval $\bar{G}_x$ and the squared coefficient of variation $\kappa_x$ \citep{park2019practical}:
\begin{equation}
\RR_x \approx (1 + \kappa_x r_x \bar{G}_x)^{1/\kappa_x}.
\end{equation}
The gamma assumption covers models that assume exponentially distributed generation intervals (when $\kappa=1$), corresponding to the SIR model \citep{anderson1991infectious}; various gamma assumptions and approximations are widely used in epidemic modeling, including for models of SARS-CoV-2 \citep{doi:10.1098/rsif.2020.0144}.
We use this framework to investigate how inferences about strength and speed of the variant depend on our assumptions about the underlying generation-interval distributions.
For simplicity we neglect differences in the squared coefficient of variation and assume $\kappa_w = \kappa_v = \kappa$; instead, we focus on the effect of potential differences in the mean generation intervals.

\section{Inferring relative strength from relative speed}

Epidemic speed $r_x$ is often estimated directly from case data \citep{mills2004transmissibility,nishiura2009transmission,ma2014estimating}.
Studies of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, however, have mostly focused on characterizing changes in \emph{proportion} of a new variant \citep{switzerland2021variant, davies2021estimated, di2021impact, leung2021early, volz2021transmission,zhao2021}.
This has the advantage of correcting for testing patterns and intensity, and possibly for other transient effects that might affect variants and wild type viruses similarly.
When incidence is changing exponentially ($i_x(t) = i_x(t_0) \exp(r_x t)$), the proportion of the new variant $p(t)$ follows a logistic equation:
\begin{align}
p(t) &= \frac{i_v(t_0) \exp(r_v t)}{i_w(t_0) \exp(r_w t) + i_v(t_0) \exp(r_v t)},
\\ &= \frac{1}{1 + \left(i_w(t_0)/i_v(t_0)\right) \exp(-\delta t)},
\end{align}
where the logistic growth rate $\delta = r_v - r_w$ corresponds to the relative speed of the epidemic.

}
\label{fig:relstrength}
\end{figure}

As our baseline scenario, we assume $\delta = 0.1/\textrm{days}$ based on the observed relative speed of the new variant in the UK \citep{davies2021estimated}.
This speed can be then used to estimate the relative strength $\theta = \RR_v/\RR_w$ of the new variant with a caveat; such inferece depends on assumptions about the generation-interval distribution.
The mean generation interval $\bar{G}_w$ of the wild type is assumed to equal 5 days \citep{ferretti2020quantifying}.
The squared coefficient of variation $\kappa$ in generation intervals os assumed to equal 0.2 \citep{ferretti2020quantifying}---for simplicity, we assume that both the variant and the wild type have equal $\kappa$ and only consider differences in the mean.
As we expect there to be greater uncertainty in $\kappa$ than in $\bar{G}$, we evaluate the estimates of relative strength $\theta$ across a wide range of $\kappa$, ranging from 0 (delta distribution) to 1 (exponential distribution).

Previous studies have assumed that the generation-interval distributions do not differ between the wild type and the variant: $\bar{G}_v = \bar{G}_w = \bar{G}$.
In this case, the estimate of the relative strength is given by \citep{park2019practical}:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta} = \left(1 + \frac{\kappa \delta \bar{G}}{1 + \kappa r_w \bar{G}}\right)^{1/\kappa}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, estimates of relative strength $\theta$ depends not only on the relative speed $\delta$ but also on how fast the wild type is spreading in the population $r_w$---a few analyses have implicitly or explicitly neglected this factor by either assuming $r_w = 0$ \citep{switzerland2021variant} or $\kappa = 0$ \citep{davies2021estimated}, in which case we get $\hat{\theta} = \exp(\delta \bar{G})$.
Instead, if the wild type was spreading faster than previously assumed (higher $r_w$), the estimates of the relative strength $\theta$ will be go down (\fref{relstrength}A).
The relative strength also depends on the \emph{effective dispersion} in generation intervals (i.e., the amount of variability in generation intervals, as measured by $\kappa$)---using narrower distributions makes $\hat{\theta}$ less sensitive to $r_w$.

However, if the true mean generation interval of the new variant is different from that of the wild type ($\bar{G}_v \neq \bar{G}_w$), the true relative strength $\theta = \RR_v/\RR_w$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\theta = \left(\frac{1 + \kappa (r_w + \delta) \bar{G}_v}{1 + \kappa r_w \bar{G}_w}\right)^{1/\kappa}.
\end{equation}
In this case, 


In this case, the effect of the underlying speed $r_w$ on the relative strength $\theta$ can change directions---\fref{relstrength}B illustrates this effect assuming $\bar{G}_v=7\,\textrm{days}$.
As $\kappa \to 0$, this approaches
\begin{equation}
\theta \to \exp(r_w (\bar{G}_v-\bar{G}_w)+\delta G_v), 
\end{equation}
meaning that $\theta$ increases with $r_w$ (\fref{relstrength}B).
On the other hand, as $\kappa \to 1$, we have
\begin{equation}
\theta \to \frac{1 + (r_w + \delta) \bar{G}_v}{1 + r_w \bar{G}_w} = \frac{\bar{G}_v}{\bar{G}_w} + \frac{1+ \delta \bar{G}_v  - \bar{G}_v/\bar{G}_w}{1 + r_w \bar{G}_w},
\end{equation}
which decreases with $r_w$ (\fref{relstrength}B).

Therefore, neglecting potential differences in generation intervals generally leads to under-estimation of the relative strength (\fref{relstrength}C).
In some cases, this can lead to over-estimation (see $r_w < -0.1$ in \fref{relstrength}C):
Longer generation intervals lead to slower exponential decay when $\RR < 1$, meaning that the new variant can still increase in proportion ($\delta > 0$) even when $\RR_v < \RR_w$.
However, this is unlikely to be the case as the new variant spread quickly under mixed conditions.
Instead, it seems more plausible that current estimates have under-estimated the true relative strength by 1.1---1.4 fold.

\section{Inferring relative speed from relative strength}

While relative speed is easier to measure, we often do not expect $\delta$ to be constant---this can depend on epidemic and demographic factors and can vary across time and space.
Instead, assuming a constant relative strength $\theta$ better matches biological hypotheses about the new variant (e.g., increased transmission and immune escape).
Several studies have tried to predict the future spread of the new variant, including when it will replace the wild type (therefore, its relative speed $\delta$).
As our baseline scenario we assume $\theta = 1.8$ and ask how assumptions about the generation-interval distribution affect predictions of $\delta$---while this is considerably higher than most previous estimates of around 1.5 \citep{switzerland2021variant, davies2021estimated, di2021impact, leung2021early, volz2021transmission,zhao2021}, we chose this value as it better reflects the possibility that the new variant may have longer generation intervals (\fref{relstrength}).

\begin{figure}[!th]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{relspeed.pdf}
\caption{

(C) Difference between the true and the estimated relative speed of the new variant $\delta - \hat{\delta}$.

}
\label{fig:relspeed}
\end{figure}

Like others, we first ignore possible differences between the generation-interval distributions of the wild type and the new variant and try to estimate $\delta$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\delta} = \frac{(\theta \RR_w)^{\kappa_w} - \RR_w^{\kappa_w}}{\kappa_w \bar{G}_w}.
\end{equation}
In this case, the estimated $\hat{\delta}$ increases as the underlying strength of the wild type $\RR_w$ increases (\fref{relspeed}A).
Assuming a narrower distribution causes $\hat{\delta}$ to be less sensitive to $\RR_w$;
when $\kappa = 0$ (delta-distributed generation intervals), $\hat{\delta}$ remains constant.

When we allow the mean generation interval of the new variant to be long ($\bar{G}_v > \bar{G}_w$), the true $\theta$--$\delta$ relationship is given by:
\begin{equation}
\delta = \frac{(\theta \RR_w)^{\kappa} - 1}{\kappa \bar{G}_v} - \frac{\RR_w^{\kappa} - 1}{\kappa \bar{G}_w}.
\end{equation}
In this case, the direction of the effect of $\RR_w$ on $\delta$ can change depending on the value of $\kappa$.
As $\kappa \to 1$, we have
\begin{equation}
\delta \to \frac{(\bar{G}_w \theta - \bar{G}_v) \RR_w + \bar{G}_v - \bar{G}_w}{\bar{G}_v \bar{G}_w},
\end{equation}
which changes linearly with $\RR_w$ with a slope of $(\bar{G}_w \theta - \bar{G}_v)/\bar{G}_v \bar{G}_w$ (which can be either negative or positive).
For the values we consider, this increases with $\RR_w$ (\fref{relspeed}B).
On the other hand, as $\kappa \to 0$, we have
\begin{equation}
\delta \to \frac{\log(\theta \RR_w)}{\bar{G}_v} - \frac{\log(\RR_w)}{\bar{G}_w},
\end{equation}
which always decreases with $\RR_w$ provided that $\bar{G}_v > \bar{G}_w$ (\fref{relspeed}B).
Overall, estimates of $\delta$ become less sensitive to values of $\RR_w$ and range between 0.05/day and 0.15/day, which is consistent with the observed values of $\delta$ from data.
Therefore, assuming equal generation intervals generally leads to over-estimation of $\delta$ (\fref{relspeed}C).

\section{Discussion}

Here, we explored how the generation-interval distribution shapes the link between relative strength and speed of the new variant.
We define relative strength as the ratio between reproduction numbers ($\theta=\RR_v/\RR_w$) and relative speed as the difference between growth rates ($\delta=r_v-r_w$) of the variant and the wild type.
When the generation-interval distributions are assumed to be identical, we find that estimates of $\hat{\theta}$ decreases with $r_w$ whereas $\hat{\delta}$ increase with $\RR_w$.
When we account for longer generation intervals of the new variant, these relationships can change directions depending on the effective dispersion in generation intervals, which we characterized in terms of the squared coefficient of variation of the gamma distribution $\kappa$.
Therefore, even a modest differences in the mean generation intervals (2 days, in this case) can lead to considerable biases in the inference---we find that 1.1--1.4 fold under-estimation in the relative strength of the new variant is plausible.

We argue that both perspectives (i.e., whether we hold relative strength or speed constant) are useful in understanding the dynamics of the new variant.
Early in the spread, we typically want to fix the relative speed because we can directly observe it.
As more information about the transmission and immunity profiles of the new variant becomes available, it is better to fix the relative strength as it better matches biological mechanisms of its spread.
We suggest researchers to be mindful about which quantity they hold constant and how their assumptions lead to their conclusions.

Our simple framework further reveals counterintuitive, but important, insight.
In general, one would expect that stronger intervention strategies is required in order to slow down the replacement of the original strain by the new variant.
However, this is only true if both have the same mean generation intervals (\fref{relspeed}B).
If the new variant has longer generation intervals than the original strain, imposing strong intervention (therefore reducing both $\RR_w$ and $\RR_v$ by a constant amount) can result in a higher relative speed $\delta$, and therefore faster replacement of the original strain (\fref{relspeed}B).
This is not necessarily a bad news as the absolute speed ($r_v$) of the new variant still decreases as $\RR_v$ decreases.
These effects should be taken into consideration for accurate projection of the spread of the new variant.

Even though SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading for more than a year, there is still large uncertainty in its generation intervals.
Observational studies typically focus on serial intervals (i.e., time between symptom onset of the infector and the infectee; \cite{svensson2007note}) because they are easier to measure \citep{griffin2020rapid}, but they are subject to dynamical biases that can be difficult to tease apart \citep{park2021forward}.
A few studies have tried to estimate the generation-interval distribution from serial intervals with means ranging between 3--6 days and squared coefficient of variations ranging between 0.1--0.6 \citep{ferretti2020quantifying,Ferretti2020timing,ganyani2020estimating,knight2020estimating}; 
however, most estimates neglect dynamical biases in serial intervals.
In addition, serial intervals do not account for asymptomatic transmission, adding further uncertainty to inferences of speed and strength \citep{park2020time}.

Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the importance of understanding the role of generation-interval distributions in its spread has been constantly emphasized \citep{doi:10.1098/rsif.2020.0144}.
Yet, we still feel that generation intervals are under-appreciated, often viewed as a leeway to estimating $\RR$.
Future studies should consider the possibility that the new variant might have longer generation intervals and evaluate how assumptions about generation intervals affect their conclusions.
